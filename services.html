         <p>This short-specialized course offers participants the skills to develop USSD-based mobile applications that allow fast, secure communication between the user and the application without requiring an app that is downloaded. This technology works on all existing GSM mobile phones. USSD is a protocol used by GSM cellular telephones to communicate with the service provider’s computers. USSD can be used for WAP browsing, prepaid callback service, mobile-money services, location-based content services, menu-based information services, and as a part of configuring the phone on the network. Unlike short Messages services (SMS), USSD messages create a real-time connection during a USSD session that remains open, allowing a two-way exchange of a sequence of data.
